CODING RULES FOR ADVANCED TRADING  PROJECT
==============================================

CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. MANDATORY CODE REVIEW - ALL code modifications require user review and approval BEFORE implementation, even if it's a single line of code. Explain changes first, get approval, then implement.
2. NO ANALYSIS DOCUMENTS - Do NOT create analysis documents, proposals, or implementation plans. Avoid creating .md files for analysis. Focus on direct code changes only.
3. MINIMAL CHANGES ONLY - Fix bugs, make small improvements. NO refactoring or architectural changes.
4. PRESERVE EXISTING PATTERNS - Match code style, logging format, error handling exactly.
5. BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS ONLY - Fix actual bugs, add missing error handling, improve logging. NO new features unless requested.
6. MAINTAIN FUNCTIONALITY - Don't break existing features. 

BEFORE MAKING CHANGES:
- EXPLAIN changes to user and GET APPROVAL first - Even single line changes require review
- Read the entire function/module first
- Identify the exact problem and minimal fix
- Check for side effects on other code
- Verify LIVE/PAPER mode consistency

CODE MODIFICATION RULES:


NEVER MODIFY WITHOUT EXPLICIT REQUEST:
- Architecture, class structure, service dependencies
- Working logic 


SAFE TO MODIFY:
- Bug fixes (incorrect validation, missing null checks, wrong variables)
- Logging improvements (add missing logs, improve messages)
- Error handling (add try-catch, improve messages)
- Code consistency 
- Minor improvements (typos, clarity, comments)



REVIEW CHECKLIST:
- Change is minimal (< 50 lines)
- Follows existing patterns
- Fixes specific bug or adds requested improvement
- Doesn't break existing functionality

- Logging adequate
- Error handling appropriate
- No architectural changes
- No unnecessary refactoring

GOLDEN RULE: Make the smallest possible change that fixes the specific issue, following existing patterns exactly, without modifying anything else. When in doubt, preserve existing behavior.

CODE REVIEW RULES:
- Review ONE file at a time, not multiple files simultaneously
- Focus on the specific file requested for review
- Complete review of current file before moving to next file
- Provide detailed feedback on: bugs, code quality, adherence to project rules, potential issues
- When reviewing multiple files, ask user which file to review next after completing current file
- Don't review entire codebase unless explicitly requested
- For each file, check: logic correctness, error handling, logging,  pattern adherence
